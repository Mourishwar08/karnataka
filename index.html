                            By hitch-hiking: Taking a lift, most of the locals (mainly 2 wheelers) are very helpful and generally stop to give a lift. <br><br> By Bus: City buses originate from a separate City Bus Station 2 km from the Railway Station.
                            <br><br> By Car: Tourist cabs are your best option if you plan to tour the city all day or go to neighbouring towns like Srirangapatna. <br><br> By horse-drawn carriage: Horse-drawn carriages (known as a tanga) are a common
                            sight and way of getting around the tourist hotspots in Mysore. <br><br>
